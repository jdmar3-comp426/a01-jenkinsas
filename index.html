            <p>Pandora was the first mortal woman in Greek Mythology that created by Hephaestus under the instruction of
                Zeus. She was created
                to punish Prometheus for stealing fire from the gods and giving the gift of fire to the humans. Before
                she was sent to live among the humans, she was endowed with gifts from all of the Olympian gods.</p>
