                <p>Among the many gifts given to Pandora by the Olympian gods, she was given a box (more like a jar)
                    that
                    many now know as Pandora's Box. This box was full with all of the evils and diseases of humanity.
                    After
                    Pandora was created and gifted with her many gifts, she given to Epimetheus, Prometheus' brother,
                    for
                    marriage by Zeus. Epimetheus accepted the "gift" of Pandora despite warnings from his brother
                    Prometheus
                    to never take a gift from Zeus.</p>
                <p>Once Pandora and Epimetheus were married and she was living among the humans, she got very curious
                    about
                    what was in the box given to her. One day she decided to open it and when she did, all of the evils
                    and
                    diseases of humanity were released into the world. Pandora was stunned by what was happening and
                    tried
                    to quickly close the box to stop all of these things from being released into the world. She only
                    managed to keep Hope inside the box.</p>
